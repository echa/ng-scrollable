ng-scrollable
=================

Superamazing scrollbars for AngularJS

Why ng-scrollable?
------------------

ng-scrollable exists because Firefox does not support scrollbar styling using CSS and other cross-browser alternatives either require jquery ([perfect-scrollbar](https://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/)), are not flexible enough or unfriendly to layouts in complex single-page apps.

I hope you can also make use of it in your projects.

Demo: https://echa.github.com/ng-scrollable/

Features
--------

* It supports mouse, wheel, keyboard and touch input with kinetic scrolling.
* It's soft scrolling using CSS3 translate3d, transition and requestAnimationFrame.
* It's responsive, and friendly to your layout.
* It's fully customizable. CSS, scrollbar position and behaviour.
* It's small. Minified size is 10k JS + 1.4k CSS.
* It's pure Angular and Javascript. No jquery required.
* It's MIT licensed.

How to Use
----------

```html
<head>
    <link href="ng-scrollable.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.3/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="ng-scrollable.min.js"></script>
    <script>var app = angular.module('app', ['ngScrollable']);</script>
</head>
<body ng-app="app">
    <div ng-scrollable="{scrollX:'none',scrollY:'left'}" style="width: 100%; height: 300px;">
        <img src="image.png"/>
    </div>
</body>
```

If the size of your scrollable container or content changes, call
```javascript
$scope.$broadcast('content.changed');
```

from any of your content controllers inside ng-scrollable or

```javascript
$scope.$emit('content.changed');
```

from outside the ng-scrollable scope.

In case the DOM of your scrollable container changes, call
```javascript
$scope.$broadcast('content.reload');
```
from outside the ng-scrollable scope to let ng-scrollable reload DOM node references and reattach event listeners.

Consumed Events
------------------

ng-scrollable may be controlled by events sent to the directive's scope, either using `$scope.$broadcast` from the outside or `$scope.$emit` from the inside. The `scrollable.scroll.*` events move the content to absolute positions. They take no parameters.

```
$scope.$broadcast('scrollable.scroll.left')
```
Scroll to the left edge of the content. Will change the horizontal position only.

```
$scope.$broadcast('scrollable.scroll.right')
```
Scroll to the right edge of the content. Will change the horizontal position only.

```
$scope.$broadcast('scrollable.scroll.top')
```
Scroll to the top edge of the content. Will change the vertical position only.

```
$scope.$broadcast('scrollable.scroll.bottom')
```
Scroll to the top edge of the content. Will change the vertical position only.

```
$scope.$broadcast('content.changed', wait, noNotify)
```
Re-evaluate content and container size and update scrollbars in the next digest cycle or after an optional timeout defined by `wait` (in ms). If `noNotify` is True no event is sent when dimensions have changed.

```
$scope.$broadcast('content.reload', noNotify)
```
Reloads DOM references and re-registers event handlers before updating dimensions. If `noNotify` is True no event is sent when dimensions have changed.


Emitted Events
-------------------

ng-scrollable broadcasts changes in dimensions down the scope stack using `$scope.$broadcast` so inner content controllers can react appropriatly.

```
$scope.$on('scrollable.dimensions', function (e, containerWidth, containerHeight, contentWidth, contentHeight, id) {})
```
Sent on each detected change to the container or content dimensions. The first four parameters are the scrollable dimensions in CSS pixel units. `Id` may be defined using a configuration parameter (see below) to identify the scrollable container sending the event.

From v0.2.3 onwards, ng-scrollable broadcasts **scroll spy events** when the scroll position approaches one of the content's edges. The proximity may be controlled with the configuration parameter `spyMargin`, which defines a virtual margin overlapping the content edges. Once the virtual margin becomes visible inside the scrollable container, an event is triggered. The margin's size defaults to **one page**, i.e. one container width or height around the edge. Events are sent only once when entering a margin and again after leaving and re-entering the margin.

Note that with the default setting of one page no event will be sent if the content is smaller than 2x the container size in either dimension. If desired you can set sypMargin to values < 1.

```
$scope.$on('scrollable.spytop', function (e, contentTop, id) {})
```
Sent when the top scroll-spy margin becomes visible inside the scrollable container window. This event is not sent again as long as the top margin remains visible. `contentTop` is the current vertical position of the content inside the scrollable container in CSS pixels. `Id` may be defined using a configuration parameter (see below) to identify the scrollable container sending the event.

```
$scope.$on('scrollable.spybottom', function (e, contentTop, id) {})
```
Sent when the bottom scroll-spy margin becomes visible inside the scrollable container window. This event is not sent again as long as the bottom margin remains visible. `contentTop` is the current vertical position of the content inside the scrollable container in CSS pixels, similar to the `spyY` value. `Id` may be defined using a configuration parameter (see below)  to identify the scrollable container sending the event.

```
$scope.$on('scrollable.spyleft', function (e, contentLeft, id) {})
```
Sent when the left scroll-spy margin becomes visible inside the scrollable container window. This event is not sent again as long as the left margin remains visible. `contentLeft` is the current horizontal position of the content inside the scrollable container in CSS pixels. `Id` may be defined using a configuration parameter (see below)  to identify the scrollable container sending the event.

```
$scope.$on('scrollable.spyright', function (e, contentLeft, id) {})
```
Sent when the right scroll-spy margin becomes visible inside the scrollable container window. This event is not sent again as long as the right margin remains visible. `contentLeft` is the current horizontal position of the content inside the scrollable container in CSS pixels, similar to the `spyX` value. `Id` may be defined using a configuration parameter (see below)  to identify the scrollable container sending the event.



Optional parameters
-------------------

ng-scrollable supports optional parameters passed as JS object to the `ng-scrollable` attribute, e.g.
```
<div ng-scrollable="{scrollX:'none',scrollY:'left'}"></div>
```
### id
Unique Id value to identify events sent by the scrollable container. Value and type are opaque to ng-scrollable, you may use numbers, strings and even Javascript objects.

### scrollX
Position where to display the horizontal scrollbar, either `top`, `bottom` or `none`.
**Default: bottom**

### scrollY
Position where to display the vertical scrollbar, either `left`, `right` or `none`.
**Default: right**

### minSliderLength
Minimum number of pixels below the slider will not shrink in size.
**Default: 10**

### scrollXSlackSpace
Number of pixels the content width may be larger than the container width without making the horizontal scrollbar appear. This allows for some extra room so that a scrollbar is not yet visible just because of a few pixels.
**Default: 0**

### scrollYSlackSpace
Number of pixels the content height may be larger than the container height without making the vertical scrollbar appear. This allows for some extra room so that a scrollbar is not yet visible just because of a few pixels.
**Default: 0**

### wheelSpeed
Scroll speed applied to wheel event.
**Default: 1**

### useBothWheelAxes
When set to true, and only one (vertical or horizontal) scrollbar is active then both vertical and horizontal scrolling events will affect the active scrollbar.
**Default: false**

### useKeyboard
When set to true, keyboard events are used for scrolling when the mouse cursor hovers above the content. Small steps (30px) are triggered by up, down, left, right keys. Large steps (1x container width or height) are triggered by PageUp, PageDown, Home and End keys. If horizontal scrolling is inactive (either because `scrollX=='none'` or `contentWidth < containerWidth`) Home and End keys jump to top or bottom in vertical direction.
**Default: true**

### preventKeyEvents
When set to true (default), keyboard events for all keys supported by ng-scrollable (`SPACE`, `LEFT-ARROW`, `RIGHT-ARROW`, `UP-ARROW`, `DOWN-ARROW`, `PAGE-UP`, `PAGE-DOWN`, `HOME`, `END`) are prevented from triggering their default action (e.g. like scrolling the entire document). To disable this feature in your app, pass `preventKeyEvents=false` as argument.
**Default: true**

### useObserver
When set to true ngScrollable will observe DOM changes inside the scrollable content such as the addition or removal of DOM nodes and automatically trigger a refresh. Note that you still need to *manually* refresh after layout changes by sending a `content.changed` event. That is when adding or removing CSS classes or styles that influence the size of the scrollable container or any of its content.
**Default: true**

### updateOnResize
When set to true any window.resize event will trigger a full refresh of the scrollable.
**Default: true**

### scrollXAlways
Always show the horizontal scrollbar even if the content is smaller than the container.
**Default: false**

### scrollYAlways
Always show the vertical scrollbar even if the content is smaller than the container.
**Default: false**

### usePadding
Changes the way ng-scrollable determines content dimensions. When True, ng-scrollable uses clientWidth/Height instead of offsetWidth/Height.
**Default: false**

### spyMargin
Unitless factor that lets you define the size of the scroll-spy margin relative to the scrollable container's width and height. The margin (virtually) overlaps the content on all edges and triggers an event (see above) when it becomes visible. A value of `0` disables this feature.
**Default: 1.0**


Optional attributes
-------------------

ng-scrollable supports optional attributes to set or spy on the current scroll position programmatically. Spies may be bound to any Angular expression such as a scope function or scope variable. If the expression evaluates to a settable entity (i.e. a variable), ng-scrollable will set it to the current scroll position in pixels.

### spyX
Spy on and control the horizontal scrollbar position.

### spyY
Spy on and control the vertical scrollbar position.

**A note on performance:** Using a settable spy property such as a scope or controller variable (e.g. `scope.pos` and `<div ng-scrollable spy-y="pos"></div>`) has a **huge performance impact** on your application because ng-scrollable runs an Angular digest cycle on each update. Although the digest visits child scopes inside the scrollable container only, it may still affect smooth scrolling, in particular, when you host many or complex directives.

As an alternative, consider using **scroll spy events** for observing edge proximity and getter functions for passing new position values, e.g.

```
// JS
var pos = 10;
scope.getPos = function () { return pos; }

// Template
<div ng-scrollable spy-y="getPos()"></div>
```

Optional CSS classes
--------------------

ng-scrollable looks for the option CSS class `scrollable-ignore` when processing wheel events and does not scroll its content when present. You may use this class anywhere inside the scrollable-content container to define nodes that should be excluded from scrolling such as dropdown menus or other `overflow: scroll` elements.



How does it work?
-----------------

* ng-scrollable is pure Javascript and only requires Angular.
* Content is wrapped with `ng-transclude` into an `overflow:hidden` container.
* Scrollbars are added as sibling element and positioned absolute over the content.
* Content and scrollbars are soft moving using CSS3 transform3d and transition.
* Kinetic scrolling using requestAnimationFrame is enabled on touch devices.
* You can disable X and Y scrolling and choose where scrollbars are displayed.
* Window resize events are captured to recalculate scrollbar size and position.
* You can optionally signal content changes by emitting a `content.changed` event or reload everything with a `content.reload` event.

Cool, isn't it?


Install
-------

When you already use Bower, the easiest way to get started with ng-scrollable is

```
bower install ng-scrollable
```

You can also download the latest stable [release](https://echa.github.io/ng-scrollable/releases) from GitHub. If you are brave and can't wait for new releases go ahead and fetch the development version by cloning the [Github repository](https://github.com/echa/ng-scrollable/).

```
git clone https://github.com/echa/ng-scrollable.git
cd ng-scrollable
```

Developing
----------

You need `grunt` to lint and minimize sources. Otherwise the project is really simple. I assume you already know what you are doing.

Usage
```
grunt lint  - check source files
grunt build - build minified version
```


Limitations
------------

When using ng-scrollable in combination with other Angular directives on the same DOM element, keep in mind that ng-scrollable already injects a HTML template. If other directives have templates as well, they must be linked to separate DOM nodes.

So, for example, if you want to make a `ng-view` or `ui-view` scrollable, your HTML should look like

```
<div ng-scrollable>
	<div ui-view></div>
</div>
```

### Scrollable Container Positioning

The scrollable container must have position relative or absolute for scrollbars to be visible. The CSS class `.scrollable` already takes care of this, but keep in mind to not interfere when styling the container.


### Scrollbar and Content Styling

Scrollbars are placed absolute above the content and inside the scrollable container. Their CSS defines some transparency per default, but they don't *push*  content aside. If you want bars beeing displayed beside your content you need to specify explicit margins on your content yourself. To assist you, ng-scrollable inserts the following classes on the content wrapper element when a scrollbar is displayed:

```
scrollable-top
scrollable-right
scrollable-bottom
scrollable-left
```

Note that these classes get inserted only when scrolling is not disabled and when the content width or height is larger than the containers width or height.


### Scrollable Size Updates

In contrast to browser scrollbars, ng-scrollable does not update automatically with content size. To avoid polling the DOM for changes there is two explicit update mechanism.

1. ng-scrollable updates on window resize event (enabled by default)
2. ng-scrollable updates on user event `content.changed`

You may at any time trigger an update from a controller inside the transcluded content by calling

```
$scope.$emit('content.changed');
```

### Compatibility

ng-scrollable was tested to work with Angular 1.2.18 up to 1.4.3. However it should be backwards compatible down to Angular 1.1 since it does not use any special features introduced in later versions.

This project only considers supporting recent browser versions to keep the source small and usable (hence, no IE 6/7/8 or other broken browser implementations). Since ng-scrollable doesn't use touch events yet, guestures on mobiles don't work.

I have verified this plugin works with the following Desktop browsers

* Firefox 30 .. 42
* Chrome 35 .. 44 and
* Safari 6.1.4 .. 9.0.1 (OSX)

It may or may not work with other browsers. Let me know your experiences and send pull requests!

When you need support for older browsers, please fork the project and make your own changes.
